# Hey there! 👋 I'm Marais Devis

Full Stack Web Developer with a background in Event Support and Technical Coordination

I have recently stepped into the world of Web Development, and am eager to learn a lot more and expand my Tech-Stack and horizons.
A dream of mine would be to eventually develop my own AI.

- 👨‍💻 UpLeveled Fullstack Web Development bootcamp student
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my final project called [Event Network Project](https://github.com/Draikth/nextjs-event-network-project) which is a full stack web application, where users can find out what events might be happening in and around their city
